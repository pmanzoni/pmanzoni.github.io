From November 1992 to February 1993 he did an internship at the Bellcore Labs, Red Bank, New Jersey, USA, and from February 1994 to November 1994 he was a visiting researcher at the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) Berkeley, California, USA. His research activity is related to the use of Mobile Wireless Networks to the design of dynamic systems. He is currently working on solutions for the Internet of Things focussing on LPWAN-based networks, and Pub/Sub systems. The overall focus is on the design of sustainable solutions, that is, solutions that try to consider at least one of sustainability's three main pillars: the economy, society, and the environment (these principles are also informally referred to as profit, people, and the planet): Economy: e.g. potential cost savings for customers through the use of the proposed solution Environment: e.g. ensuring standards are met, developing environmentally sound solutions Society: e.g. enhancing safety in production, use or end-of-life, stakeholder perception of solutions He is currently a full professor of computer engineering at the \"Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Val\u00e8ncia\", Spain. He is the coordinator of the Computer Networks Research Group (GRC) and a senior member of the IEEE.
