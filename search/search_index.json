He received a master's degree in Computer Science from the \"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi\" of Milan, Italy, in 1989 and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the \"Politecnico di Milano,\" Italy, in 1995. From November 1992 to February 1993, he was an intern at Bellcore Labs, Red Bank, New Jersey, USA. From February 1994 to November 1994, he was a visiting researcher at the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) Berkeley, California, USA. His research has always been focused on using Mobile Wireless Networks to create dynamic systems. Currently, he is developing solutions for the Internet of Things using LPWAN networks and Pub/Sub systems. These solutions have various applications, including environmental intelligence by integrating TinyML based solutions, sustainable and green IoT, and Smart Tourism. Additionally, he is interested in exploring different aspects of network pluralism and finding ways to provide integrated connectivity in the edge cloud continuum. He is the coordinator of the Computer Networks Research Group (GRC) , a senior member of the IEEE, and a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Hyper-Intelligence , the IEEE SIG on Metaverse , and the ACM SIGCAS - Computers and Society .
