He received the master degree in Computer Science from the \"Universit\u00e0 degli Studi\" of Milan, Italy, in 1989, and the PhD degree in Computer Science from the \"Politecnico di Milano\", Italy, in 1995. From November 1992 to February 1993 he did an internship at the Bellcore Labs, Red Bank, New Jersey, USA, and from February 1994 to November 1994 he was a visiting researcher at the ICSI (International Computer Science Institute) Berkeley, California, USA. His research activity is related to the use of Mobile Wireless Networks to the design of dynamic systems. He is currently working on solutions for the Internet of Things focussing on LPWAN-based networks, and Pub/Sub systems. The overall focus is on the design of sustainable solutions, that is, solutions that try to consider at least one of sustainability's three main pillars: the economy, society, and the environment (these principles are also informally referred to as profit, people, and the planet). He is the coordinator of the Computer Networks Research Group (GRC) , a senior member of the IEEE, and a member of the IEEE Technical Committee on Hyper-Intelligence .
